 * Everything here is an explicit action on the *data*: re-read the like counts,
 * re-read the citation counts, open the paper's alphaXiv page, open Google
 * Scholar's verification page, or take this plugin's records back out of
 * `Extra`. Looking a paper up is not one of them — matching runs on its own, in
 * the background, at the confidence threshold the settings ask for.
 *
 * The clear action deletes only what this plugin wrote (`alphaxiv_*` lines,
 * through `stripAlphaLikesData`); everything else an item has in `Extra` stays
 * exactly as it was, and nothing outside `Extra` is touched. Cleared items are
 * not written to again until they are refreshed, which is what keeps the next
 * automatic lookup from undoing the action. The manual pickers (find the arXiv
 * ID, choose a Scholar record) stay removed, and scripts/check-addon.py holds
 * both ends of that line rather than memory.
